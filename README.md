# BBB
Blood-Brain Barrier
BBB is a physiological barrier that maintains the homesotasis of the central nervous system (CNS).
BBB is formed by brain endothelial cells, with paracellular tight junctions and transcellular transport systems.
The function of the BBB is regulated by endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, and interneurons that together form the neurovascular unit (NVU).
